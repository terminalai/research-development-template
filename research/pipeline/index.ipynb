    "### 6. Data, Model & Loss - the components of a ML workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this template constitutes of three notebooks: data, model and loss.\n",
    "The notebooks running number prefix (`00_data.ipynb` etc.) to emphasize the running order and to improve readability.\n",
    "Any data project can be resolved by defining these three steps. Together they form a basis for a complete ML workflow from data to trained deployable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be used to doing all the steps in a single script or notebook,\n",
    "but separating makes development, explaining the results and debugging much more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook is also a basis for a python module, including tests and documentation.\n",
    "The `nbdev` tool constructs a python module of each of these notebooks, under the folder `[your_repository]/[your_module]/`\n",
    "(`ml_project_template/ml_project_template/` in this template).\n",
    "The name of the module becomes the name of your repository after installing the template following the instructions below\n",
    "This allows you to share code between your notebooks, or even publish a complete python module, while doing all your development in the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data notebook, the the data is loaded and cleaned, and a basic analysis may be carried out.\n",
    "With nbdev you can also export data handling functions to be used in other notebooks.\n",
    "You should also create a small toy dataset to develop and test your algorithm with - no,\n",
    "trust me, your code won't work for the first n+1 times, and running it with the whole dataset will waste so much time!\n",
    "This is also why we separate between the model and loss notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model notebook, the machine learning model (or analytics or simulation) is explored, defined and tested.\n",
    "You can begin with scripting, but based on the script you should develop real generalizable and tested code.\n",
    "This part of the notebooks is the closest to traditional software development it gets: the output is a clean Python module. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loss notebook, you will finally train your model with the whole dataset and evaluate it in action.\n",
    "Some might call this step *inference*, others *evaluation*.\n",
    "No matter the name, you evaluate the performance of your model to see if it is ready for production.\n",
    "If the results are satisfactory, you can ship your code to it's destination.\n",
    "For example Azure SDK allows you to define your code in Python and then excecute it in the cloud, seamlessly.\n",
    "However, this part depends a lot on the project, so we'll leave it to you to figure it out.\n",
    "If your are doing research, having the results in the notebooks might be enough for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "We added the fourth notebook to enable automatic workflow control of the notebooks.\n",
    "With the help of this notebook, you can create workflows to automatically update, train and deploy your ML model.\n",
    "The workflows can either be static or dynamic, and you can even parameterize them to automatically update your workflow definition.\n",
    "Usually this notebook is the last one you need to touch, so you don't need to mind it in the beginning.\n",
    "However, if you have multiple or varying number of data sources, or a very complex workflow,\n",
    "you might want to define a dynamic workflow already in the early development phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create new notebooks to your liking. For example, if you want to create and create many algorithms that are inheritantly different\n",
    "it might be better to separate them in their own notebooks `02a_model1.ipynb` and `02b_model2.ipynb`."
